Tik Tok



Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy
(Hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city
(Let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Trying on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pulling up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh

Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now, the dudes are lining up cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting drunk, drunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

Now, now, we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-Poliece shut us dowwnn

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick Tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me

With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah, you got me

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me

With my hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh !!

Break Your Heart

Now I may not be the worst or the best but you gotta respect my honesty
And I may break your heart, but I don't really think there's anybody's as bomb as me
So you can take this chance, in the end everybody's gonna be wondering how ya deal
You might say this is Ludacris, but Taio Cruz tell em' how ya feel!

Now listen to me baby before I love and leave you
They call me heart breaker, I don't wanna decieve you

If you fall for me, I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart, told you from the start, baby from the start

I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart

There's not point trying to hide it, no point trying to evade it
I know I got a problem by doing this behaving

If you fall for me, I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart, told you from the start, baby from the start

I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart

[Ludacris:]
(That's all I'm gonna do woman)
Listen, now I'm only gonna break your heart
And shatter and spatter it all into little itty bitty pieces
Whether or not you get it all together
Then its finders, keepers and losers, weepers
See I'm not trying lead you on, no I'm? only trying keep it real
You might say this is Ludacris, but Taio Cruz tell her how you feel!

And I know karma's gonna get me back for being so cold
Like a big bad wolf I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone
If you fall for me I'm only gonna tear you apart
Told you from the start

I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart

[Bruno Mars]
Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

[B.o.B]
Not not not nothing on you baby
Not not nothing on you
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel so around I spun (spun)
With no directions just tryna get some (some)
Trin'a chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)
This is how I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly I ended up with none

There's no much nonsense
It's on my conscience
I'm thinking baby I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering if there was something that you wanna know
(That you wanna know)
But never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts just let them go (go, go, go)

I been around and I never seen another one

And you out and you ain't got nothing on
Baby you the whole package plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them other stay plastic
You're my wonder women call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop... Now think about it

I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even went out there to Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia to New Orleans
But you always steal to show (steal to show)
And just like that girl you got me fro (got me fro)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew well now you know (know, know, know)

California Gurls

[Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Katy Perry]
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Lovin n' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees, undone
The boys, break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek, at us

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the Golden Coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh oh oh oh

California gurls
We're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh oh oh oh

California gurls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh oh

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the Golden Coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh oh oh oh

California gurls
We're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh oh oh oh

California gurls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh

[Snoop Dogg]
Toned tan, fit and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones
I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her,
Squeeze her buns

The girl's a freak
She drives a jeep
And live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bait, just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summer time is everything

Homeboys bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis
No weenies
Just a king and a queenie
Katy my lady,

[Katy Perry]
Yeah...

[Snoop Dogg]
You lookie here baby,

[Katy Perry]
Uh huh...

I'm all up on you
'Cause you representin' California

Love the Way You Lie


[Refrain - Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there
And watch me burn
But it's alright
Because I like
The way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
And hear me cry
But that's alright
Because I love
The way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife
In my windpipe
I can't breathe
But I still fight
While I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right
It's like I'm in flight
High of a love
Drunk from the hate
It's like I'm huffing paint
And I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me
She fucking hates me
And I love it
Wait
Where you going
I'm leaving you
No you ain't
Come back
We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane
'Cause when it's going good
It's going great
I'm Superman
With the wind at his back
She's Lois Lane
But when it's bad
It's awful
I feel so ashamed
I snap
Who's that dude
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Refrain - Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there
And watch me burn
But that's alright
Because I like
The way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
And hear me cry
But that's alright
Because I love
The way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe
When you're with them
You meet
And neither one of you
Even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah them chills
Used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick
Of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em
Never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom
And these words
When you spit 'em
You push
Pull each other's hair
Scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down
Pin 'em
So lost in the moments
When you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over
It controls you both
So they say it's best
To go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today
That was yesterday
Yesterday is over
It's a different day
Sound like broken records
Playin' over
But you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Refrain - Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there
And watch me burn
But that's alright
Because I like
The way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
And hear me cry
But that's alright
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Eminem]
Now I know we said things
Did things
That we didn't mean
And we fall back
Into the same patterns
Same routine
But your temper's just as bad
As mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love
You're just as blinded
Baby please come back
It wasn't you
Baby it was me
Maybe our relationship
Isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens
When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is
I love you too much
To walk away though
Come inside
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity
In my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed
I'll aim my fist
At the dry wall
Next time
There will be no next time
I apologize
Even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games
I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm 'na tie her to the bed
And set the house on fire

[Refrain - Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there
And watch me burn
But that's alright
Because I like
The way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
And hear me cry
But that's alright
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie.

Teenage Dream

(Verse)
You think I'm pretty
Without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the
Punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me I was alright
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life,
Now every February
You'll be my Valentine, Valentine

(Pre-chorus)
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

(Chorus)
You make me
Feel like I'm living a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back.

(Verse)
We drove to Cali and got drunk
On the beach
Got a motel and built a fort
Out of sheets
I finally found you,
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

(Pre-chorus)
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

(Chorus)
You make me
Feel like I'm living a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back.

I'ma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

(Chorus)
You make me
Feel like I'm living a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back.

The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back.

(Verse)
We drove to Cali and got drunk
On the beach
Got a motel and built a fort
Out of sheets
I finally found you,
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

(Pre-chorus)
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

(Chorus)
You make me
Feel like I'm living a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back.

I'ma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight.

(Chorus)
You make me
Feel like I'm living a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back.

I'ma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight. we and my thugs can die tonight yp forever

Just the Way You Are



Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday.

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look okay?
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

Oh, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are.
yeah yeah

Raise Your Glass



Right, right turn off the light
We gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the dealeo?

I love when it's all too much
5 a.m., turn the radio up
Where's the rock and roll?

Party crashers, penny snatchers
Call me up if you a gangster
Don't be fancy, just get dancey
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud and nitty gritty, dirty little freaks

Won't you come on and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass

Slam, slam, oh hot damn
What part of party don't you understand?
Wish you'd just freak out

Can't stop coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It's so on right now
(It's so fucking on right now)

Party crasher, penny snatcher
Call me up if you a gangster
Don't be fancy, just get dancey
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud and nitty gritty, dirty little freaks

Won't you come on and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass

Won't you come on and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass

Oh shit, my glass is empty
That sucks

So if you're too school for cool
And you're treated like a fool
You could choose to let it go
We can always, we can always party on our own

So raise your, so raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud and nitty gritty, dirty little freaks

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud and nitty gritty, dirty little freaks

Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass

Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass for me
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass for me

Firework



Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin?
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky, I, I

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
And make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em going, "Oh, oh, oh"

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe you reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky, I, I

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em going, "Oh, oh, oh"

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through, ooh, ooh

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky, I, I

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em going, "Oh, oh, oh"

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

Grenade



Easy come easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause

what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
oh oh oh oh

I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no

Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are, yeah
You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause

what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Oooh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya

I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you never do the same
No, no, no,oh

Hold It Against Me



Hey, over there, please forgive me
If I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song

So come here a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, little question
Wanna know just how you feel

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny

There's a spark in between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So I'm asking you tonight

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

If I said I want your body
Would you hold it against me?

Gimme something good
Don't wanna wait, I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out

Alright
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

E.T.



You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing

They say be afraid
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star

I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Rolling in the Deep

There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fevered pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
Finally, I can see you crystal clear,
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare,
See how I'll leave with every piece of you,
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.

There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark.

The scars of your love remind me of us,
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,
I can't help feeling,

We could have had it all,
(Your gonna wish you, never had met me)
Rolling in the deep,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told,
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn,
Think of me in the depths of your despair,
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared,

The scars of your love remind me of us,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
I can't help feeling,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all,
Rolling in the deep,
You had my heart inside of your hands,
But you played it with a beating.

Throw your soul through every open door,
Count your blessings to find what you look for.
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown.

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all.
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
It all, it all, it all.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me

But you played it,
You played it,
You played it,
You played it to the beat.

And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-yo, Tesra

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All the games, they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love

(Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Get busy tonight
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless

It's insane to wait and they ain't growin' money
Keep flowin', hustlers move beside us
So I'm tip-toeing to keep blowing
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan

Put it on my lap, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I'll promise tonight

Excuse me but I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say

(Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Reach for the stars
And if you don't grab them, at least you're on top of the world
Think about it
'Cause if you slip, I'm gonna fall on top of your girl

When I'm involved, it goes deeper than them aces
Baby, baby, and it ain't no secret
My family is from Cuba, but I'm an American Idol
Gettin' money like Seacrest

Put it on my light, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I'll promise tonight

Excuse me but I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All the games, they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love

I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey

Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked-out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trios

Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
ooh-ohh

This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked-out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois

Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
ooh-ohh

This Friday night
Do it all again
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again
Do it all again

Moves Like Jagger



[Verse 1]
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
Then aim for my heart
If you feel like it
take me away, make it okay
I swear I'll behave

You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now we're naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this

[Chorus]
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you

all them moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves... like jagger

I don't need try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you

With them the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves... like jagger

[Verse 2]
Maybe it's hard
When you feel like you're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I make you believe
That I've got the key

So get in the car
We can ride it
Wherever you want
Get inside it
And you want to steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here
And it goes like this

[Chorus]
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you

all the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves... like jagger

I don't need try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you

With them the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves... like jagger

[Bridge]
You wanna know how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this

So watch and learn
I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, roll me right
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this

And it goes like this

[Chorus]
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you

All the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves... like jagger

I don't need try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you

With them the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves... like jagger

Someone Like You

I heard, that you're settled down,
That you, found a girl and your married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you.

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded,
That for me, it isn't over.

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best, for you too.
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said,
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah.

You'd know, how the time flies.
Only yesterday, was the time of our lives.
We were born and raised in a summer haze,
Bound by the surprise of our glory days.

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I'd hoped you'd see my face & that you'd be reminded,
That for me, it isn't over.

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you say,
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead", yay.

Nothing compares, no worries or cares.
Regret's and mistakes they're memories made.
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you.
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said,
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.
Don't forget me, I beg, I remembered you say,
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yay yeh yeah.

We Found Love



[Narration]
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed
That someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless; like nothing can save you
And when it's over, and it's gone
You almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

[Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine)

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

When I Way Your Man

Same bed but it feels just
A little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio
But it dont sound the same
When our friends talk about you
All it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little
When I hear your name
It all just sounds like (oooooh)
Mmm too young too dumb to realize
That i

Should of bought you flowers
And held you hands
Should of gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing
But shes dancing with another man

My pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways
Cause the good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never never get to clean up the mess I made
Ooh and it hunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like (oooooh)
Mmm too young too dumb to realize
That i

Should of bought you flowers
And held your hands
Should of gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing
But shes dancing with another man

Although it hurts
Ill be the first to say
That I was wrooooong
Oooh I know im probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he hold you hands
Give you all hes hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember how much
You loved to dance
Do all the things I should of done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should of done
When I was your man

Just Give Me a Reason

Right from the start, you were a thief,
You stole my heart and
I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty.
And with every touch
You fixed them.
Now, you've been talking in your sleep
Oh oh, things you never say to me
Oh oh, tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love.

Just give me a reason,
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken
Just bent and we can learn to love again.
It's in the stars,
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're NOT broken
Just bent and we can learn to love again.

I'm sorry I don't understand where
All of this is coming from.
I thought that we were fine,
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, WE still have everything
And it's all in your MIND.
(Yeah, but this is happenin')
You've been having real bad dreams
Oh oh, you use to lie so close to me
Oh oh, there's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Ooooh, our love, our love.

Just give me a reason,
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken
Just bent and we can learn to LOVE again.
I never stopped
It's still written in the scars on my heart
You're NOT broken
Just bent and we can learn to love again.

Oh, tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust,
But our love's enough.
You're holding it in,
You're pouring a drink
No, nothing is as bad as it seems.
We'll come clean!

Just give me a reason,
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken
Just bent and we can learn to LOVE again.
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That We're NOT broken
Just bent and we can learn to love again.

Just give me a reason,
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken
Just bent and we can learn to LOVE again.
Oh, it's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That We're NOT broken
Just bent and we can learn to love again.

Ooh, we can learn to love again
Ooh, we can learn to love again
Oh, that we're not broken
Just bent and we can learn to love again

Can't Hold Us



Hey, hey, hey
Yeah, lets go
Alright, Alright OK
Alright OK
Alright OK

Return of the Mack's, get 'em
What it is what it does what it is what it isn't
Lookin' for a better way to get up out of bed instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit, get up!
Thrift shop, pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cocky
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game nope nope y'all can't copy

Yup. Bad, moonwalking
This here, is our party
My posse's been on Broadway
And we did it, our way
Throne music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me. on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat, crushin labels off
Yeah, Nah they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country
Labels out here
Nah they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people
Spread it across the country

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now can I kick it? thank you
Yeah I'm so damn grateful
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Yall can't stop me
Go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome
Ceasar will make you a believer
Nah I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people.
Nah sing a song and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

So we put our hands up
So we put our hands up

Lets go

Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na
Macklemore

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Nothing like your last guy, he too square for you

Roar

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
‘Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR
Louder, louder than a lion
‘Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll hear me ROAR
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me ROAR

Roar-or, roar-or, roar-or, roar-or, roar-or

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
‘Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR
Louder, louder than a lion
‘Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me ROAR
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll hear me ROAR
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me ROAR

Wrecking Ball



We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me

I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you in
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you in

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

Yeah, you, you wreck me

Royals



I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In the torn up town, no post code envy

But every song's like:
Gold teeth
Grey Goose
Tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains
Ball gowns
Trashing the hotel room

We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

But everybody's like:
Crystal
Maybach
Diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes
Islands
Tigers on a gold leash

We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

But every song's like:
Gold teeth
Grey Goose
Tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains
Ball gowns
Trashing the hotel room

We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

But everybody's like:
Crystal
Maybach
Diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes
Islands
Tigers on a gold leash

We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

ooh ooh oh ooh
We're better than we've every dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen

ooh ooh oh ooh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

The Monster

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy


I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew; see, but it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
(Ooh!) Hit the lottery, oh wee
But with what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think cause I'm...


I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy


Well, that's nothing

No, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody
Once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder
Where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this?
No wonder you losing your mind, the way it wanders)
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
I think you've been wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head is saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the...

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothing


Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed
And I'm coming straight at MCs, blood get spilled
And I take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at, pumped up feeling
And shit to say back to the kids who play 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back in the draft
Turn nothing into something, still can make that, straw into gold chump
I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket face facts, I am nuts for real
But I'm okay with that, it's nothing, I'm still friends with the...


I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy


Well, that's nothing
